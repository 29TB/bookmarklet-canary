# Old README.md
>**Warning**
>This repository is retired

## Why is this not in the [main repository](https://github.com/TeamUtils/bookmarklets)?

Because this is just my testing branch, it doesn't have any relations with TeamUtils other than being a dev branch for the bookmarklets project

## Why not use a branch on the main project?
Because I'm stupid lmao ion know how to do that
